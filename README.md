# Advent of code 2024

Playing around with Go.

## Running the solution

Until I figure out something better:
change import in `main.go` to relevant day and call either `Part1()` or `Part2()`:

```go
import day "github.com/nejcambrozic/advent-of-code-24-go/day01"

func main() {
	day.Part1()
}
```

These function will print the solution to stdout.
